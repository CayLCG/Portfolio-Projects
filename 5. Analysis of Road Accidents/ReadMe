Rationale: 
          Create a road accident dashboard for the year 2021 and 2022 so that we can have visual insights about
          1. Total casualties and total accident values for current year and year-on-year growth
          2. Total casualties by severity for current year and year-on-year growth
          3. Total casualties with respect to vehicle types for current year
          4. Monthly trend showing comparison of casualties for current year and previous year
          5. Casualties by road type for current year
          6. Total casualties and total accidents by location
