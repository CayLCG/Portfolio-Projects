* I use POWER BI to craft my figures *
* However, if you do not have a POWER BI account, you would not be able to view the .pbix file *
* As such, I have exported the .pbix file to a .pdf file *
* Unfortunately, unless you have a POWER BI account, you would not be able to use the live filters, which will help you to filter data that you wish to see *
* To be used as a visual aid with 1. Data Analysis.sql *

* TLDR, the .pdf file is just an image whereas the .pbix file allows you to manipulate my figures using the interactive filters *
